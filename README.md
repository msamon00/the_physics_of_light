# The Physics of Light

This project is a clean, educational website designed to introduce the physics of light, color, and photons across multiple levels of understanding. It focuses on clarity, accessibility, and a visually appealing layout without requiring prior knowledge of physics.

## Project Summary
This website explains light concepts using simple language, structured sections, and clear examples. It is intended as both an educational resource and a demonstration of front-end development skills.

## Repository Link

## Features
- Modern, responsive layout for all devices  
- Sidebar navigation with smooth scrolling  
- Visually appealing “cards” for each topic  
- Semantic HTML for accessibility  
- Clean, dark-themed CSS design  

## Purpose
The objective of this project is to help learners understand light, from classical optics to quantum mechanics, in simple terms and to showcase strong web-design fundamentals without relying heavily on JavaScript.
